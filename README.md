# WebRTC
WebRTC, or Web Real-Time Communication, is an open-source project that enables real-time communication capabilities directly in web browsers and mobile applications. It provides a set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and protocols that allow developers to incorporate features such as voice and video calling, peer-to-peer file sharing, and real-time data exchange into web applications without the need for additional plugins or external software.

Key components of WebRTC include:

1. **getUserMedia API:**
   This API allows web applications to access the user's camera and microphone. It enables the capture of audio and video streams directly from the user's device.

2. **RTCPeerConnection:**
   This API establishes a direct connection between two peers for secure, real-time communication. It handles the negotiation and management of audio and video streams, encryption, and network traversal.

3. **RTCDataChannel:**
   This API enables peer-to-peer communication of arbitrary data, not just audio and video. It allows for the exchange of text, files, or other application-specific data between peers.

4. **RTCStats API:**
   This API provides information about the performance and quality of the communication, allowing developers to monitor and optimize their applications.

WebRTC is commonly used in applications that require real-time communication, such as video conferencing, voice calling, online gaming, and collaboration tools. It has gained widespread adoption and support across major web browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Opera.

The open nature of WebRTC and its support for peer-to-peer communication make it a versatile technology for building decentralized, low-latency, and secure real-time communication applications on the web.
